# Leveraging deep learning to detect predictive markers of sudden death in epilepsy

## Methods
In recent years, deep learning has become state of the art for many domains with large amounts of available data. Unfortunately, data is not abundant for biomedical applications where deep learning could be beneficial. Taking these limitations into account, we present a framework to apply deep learning to early prediction of the SUDEP after a generalized tonic clonic seizure, as well as  other EEG signal detection problems exhibiting extreme data paucity.

## Visualization
We also develop a system for real-time visualization of our models predictions  to emphasize which parts of the signal contributed most to the decision.
